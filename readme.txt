This plugin enables hierarchical ordering of items created by the Restaurant
plugin.

== Description ==

[Restaurant](https://wordpress.org/plugins/restaurant/) by Justin Tadlock does
not allow for manual ordering of items.  This plugin enables that.  Also
recommended is [Simple Page Ordering](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-page-ordering/).

### Technical details:

1. Sets the 'restaurant_menu' custom content type to be hierarchical
2. Sets archive pages for the 'restaurant_menu' type and 'restaurant_tag' to sort by menu_order

== Screenshots ==

1. These are items in your Restaurant menu.  Use the plugin 'Simple Page Ordering' to drag them around to reorder them.
1. This is how menu items look on the front end after being re-ordered.

== Installation ==

1. Install either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the
files to your server.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Get to work reordering your content!
